# UnityStateMachine
A simple state machine for Unity

The goal of this state machine was to be simple and portable. An Enum is paired with states to keep state tracking simple, 
and States inherit MonoBehaviour so they can be setup from within the scene.

See ExampleScene and ExampleScript.cs for setup.
