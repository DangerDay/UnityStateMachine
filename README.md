# UnityStateMachine
A simple state machine for Unity

A lightweight state machine system for Unity. States are paired with a StateIdentifier so that checking, assigning, and loading states are kept simple and straightforward. States themselves are MonoBehaviours so references and setup can be done from the scene in the editor.

See ExampleScene and ExampleScript.cs for setup.
